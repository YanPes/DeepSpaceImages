# DeepSpaceImages
The idea behind Deep Space Images came from working with raw data streams of cameras. The fact that an image basically is a container storing data made me curious about using this information as input for another purpose.  I wanted to generate something new which represents the complexity of the actual data as well as keeping the look and feel of the original reference.
